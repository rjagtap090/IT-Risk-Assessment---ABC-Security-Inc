# IT Risk Assessment - ABC Security Inc.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive IT Risk Assessment conducted for ABC Security Inc., a leading cloud-native email security platform based in San Francisco, CA. The assessment focuses on identifying and mitigating risks associated with the company’s email security platform, which utilizes AI-based behavioral data science to protect against sophisticated email-based attacks.

## Project Summary

The project was part of the MISY 650: Security and Control course at the University of Delaware. Our team evaluated the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities within ABC’s email security system, providing a detailed risk assessment that includes risk scoring, classification, and recommended countermeasures.

### University:
- **University of Delaware**

## Key Components

- **Initial Assessment**: Information gathering and review of ABC’s existing systems, network diagrams, and security documentation.
- **Risk Matrix Development**: Structured risk metrics based on potential threats and vulnerabilities, leading to a risk score for each identified asset.
- **Risk Scoring Classification**: Categorized risks into Low, Medium, and High, with corresponding action plans.
- **Threat Statement**: Identification of the top threats, including state-sponsored actors targeting the email server, external hackers aiming at customer email data, and insider threats jeopardizing threat intelligence.
- **Recommendations**: Proposed measures to strengthen ABC’s defenses and optimize cybersecurity investments.

## System Architecture

The project also includes a basic system architecture for ABC’s email security operations, outlining components such as:
- **Frontend**: UI Dashboard, Alerting System, Reporting Module
- **Middleware**: Incident Management, Integration Layer
- **Backend Components**: Detection Engine, Email Security Gateway, Endpoint Security, Network Security
- **Data Storage**: Event Logging, Threat Intel Database
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Monitoring and Incident Response

## Conclusion

The risk assessment provides a systematic evaluation of potential threats to ABC’s email security platform and suggests actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks. By implementing the proposed measures, ABC can enhance its security posture and maintain robust protection against evolving email threats.
